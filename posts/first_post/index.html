    <p>This post will serve to introduce you to some of my work as a research assistant while future blogs will detail past and current projects more acutely. I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at Temple University working under Dr. Li Bai in the Computer Fusion Laboratory (CFL). I previously worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at The College of New Jersey working under Dr. Ambrose Adegbege in the Laboratory for Embedded Control and Optimization (LECO). My interests lie in Optimal Control Theory, Multi-Agent Robotics, Robotic Simulation, and Autonomous Navigation.<br>
Here is a list of projects I have worked on during my career to help guide which posts you may want to read:</p>
<p>** UAV, UUV, ASV Autonomous Navigation and Mapping of Maritime Environments **</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a suite of vehicles to map the outer surface of an edifice above or below water. ROS is used to benchmark the control schema used for different methods of accomplishing this task before deployment. Different sensors are tested and augmented to improve visibility in low-light areas. Machine learning is used both to improve sensor capability as well as improve health prognostics of the vehicle communication stack.</p>
<p>** Analog Model Predictive Control Algorithm on Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) **</p>
<p>Recent advances in model predictive control have allowed for implementation of the complex control algorithm in new formats. By converting the control program into a quadratic programming problem and solving continuously a new formulation of model predictive control was created to work on analog platforms such as an FPAA. The paper, “Analog Solver for Embedded Model Predictive Control with Application to Quadruple Tank System” was published to the American Control Conference (ACC) 2021.</p>
<p>** Embedded Model Predictive Control on FPGA **</p>
<p>The modularity of an FPGA can be exploited to create complex control architectures suitable for resolving dynamic control problems. Reformulating the model predictive control problem allows for rapid implementation and control of systems such as the quadruple water tank. The paper, “An Embedded FPGA Architecture for Real-Time Model Predictive Control” was published to the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) 2020.</p>
<p>** Pre-Ictal Electroencephalographic Pattern Recognition Monitoring Device (PEIPR MD) **</p>
<p>Few options exist for those in need of convenient EEG monitoring. Routine EEG scans require the patient to visit a hospital where they are hooked up for up to an hour. This does little to nothing in detection of ictal waveforms for those prone to epilepsy or seizures. PEIPR MD is an on-the-go EEG monitoring headset intended to resolve the problems. The low cost device would detect strange behavior in the users brain waves and transmit to an online database where both user and physician can access and be notified. The PEIPR MD final report can be found in the eponymous post.</p>
<p>** Luminescence Based  Autonomous Lettuce Irrigation System **</p>
<p>Growing as a person requires constant decision making between activities that define us and activities that cannot consume our time. While a pause to my career would allow me to pursue my passion for growing plants it would not be beneficial to my research longevity. To humor my hobby, I built a device to regulate the watering of lettuce plants. A water moisture sensor and photoresistor determine optimal watering times without human intervention.</p>
