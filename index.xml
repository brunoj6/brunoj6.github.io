      <description>This post will serve to introduce you to some of my work as a research assistant while future blogs will detail past and current projects more acutely. I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at Temple University working under Dr. Li Bai in the Computer Fusion Laboratory (CFL). I previously worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at The College of New Jersey working under Dr. Ambrose Adegbege in the Laboratory for Embedded Control and Optimization (LECO).</description>

      <description>I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Electrical Engineer at Temple University while working as a research assistant in robotic systems in the Computer Fusion Lab (CFL). I have a strong desire to conduct academic research in the robotics and control fields. Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking, photography, and learning new skills. My current work-in-progress skills are drone photography and video editing.
Research Focus: I enjoy optimizing the structure of robotic systems.</description>
